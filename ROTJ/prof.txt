// Profs idea
    * Have no benefit other than hit chance and some damage
    * plus to "Dual Blaster Combat" has no real advantage because it cant go above 100 and you can train to that regardless
// every 10% in a weapon will add 1 hitroll and 1 damroll with that weapon
// 25% with every weapon will give a bonus to using that weapon in defensive/offensive
// 50% will give a small passive to the characer
// 75 and 100% will give usable abilities, these are limited to the amount you can have per toon, allowing mass customizability

// Prof commands
    * Profprac will unlock any prof as long as you arent over your limited
    * Profunlock will unlock a prof from 25/50/75 and advance is 1%
    * Profrevert will revert a prof back 25% if you want to change your build

// Misc. Suggestions
- Make the "hail" command usable by all characters at level one, transports all followers from anywhere in the game to your current location. Completely remove Call Droid from the game. This is a QoL thing that isnt breaking anything. It is utterly annoying to constantly transport followers or have to micro them.

- The "release" command to release a follower should target the group window and work from anywhere in the MUD

- Make unkillable trainers for all professions. Legends running around killing everything and not being able to level or train is extremely annoying, especially for newbies. (Especially now that all GMs are legends)

- Make skills learned when gaining a level actually raise from using it in case you have no practices. (If you can already, the chance is astronomically small. I used Overcharge Pistol literally hundreds of times, never succeeded once, never got a skill up from awful.)

- Remove subbing gear innately to every character. I have heard multiple times that this game is referred to as diablo MUD with star wars. Most players do not want to lose things, there is a reason why "soulslike and roguelike" games have such a small fan base. Instead make it like hardcore mode in diablo, you can elect to receive some kind of bonus like serving the emporer and the negative is random chance to subb gear. Or just remove it all together! Mechanics like subbing gear dont make anything more challenging really, just pisses people off.

- Remove Hunger / Thirst from the game as a detriment. It spams you out unncessisarily and it very annoying. Instead of negative, turn it into an optional positive. Not being hungry or thirsty makes you "well fed" and you regen faster or take less damage or something.

- Grouping incentives. Increased exp while grouping, increased drop rates, bonus to stats. Just something that gives an incentive to group. While the sole focus of the game is not to group, there should be SOME incentive for doing it. 

- Gear at appropriate levels. GMs should give decent gear equivalent to level on top of random GM redeems. It is very hard to gear, especially for a newbie. Unless you have a veteran player hook you up.

- Allow players to use credits or exp to enable bonus for a limited time

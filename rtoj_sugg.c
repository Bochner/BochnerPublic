// Misc. Suggestions
- Make the "hail" command usable by all characters at level one, transports all followers from anywhere in the game to your current location. Completely remove Call Droid from the game. This is a QoL thing that isnt breaking anything. It is utterly annoying to constantly transport followers or have to micro them.

- The "release" command to release a follower should target the group window and work from anywhere in the MUD

- Make unkillable trainers for all professions. Legends running around killing everything and not being able to level or train is extremely annoying, especially for newbies. (Especially now that all GMs are legends)

- Make skills learned when gaining a level actually raise from using it in case you have no practices. (If you can already, the chance is astronomically small. I used Overcharge Pistol literally hundreds of times, never succeeded once, never got a skill up from awful.)

- Remove subbing gear innately to every character. I have heard multiple times that this game is referred to as diablo MUD with star wars. Most players do not want to lose things, there is a reason why "soulslike and roguelike" games have such a small fan base. Instead make it like hardcore mode in diablo, you can elect to receive some kind of bonus like serving the emporer and the negative is random chance to subb gear. Or just remove it all together! Mechanics like subbing gear dont make anything more challenging really, just pisses people off.

- Remove Hunger / Thirst from the game as a detriment. It spams you out unncessisarily and it very annoying. Instead of negative, turn it into an optional positive. Not being hungry or thirsty makes you "well fed" and you regen faster or take less damage or something.

- Grouping incentives. Increased exp while grouping, increased drop rates, bonus to stats. Just something that gives an incentive to group. While the sole focus of the game is not to group, there should be SOME incentive for doing it. 

- Gear at appropriate levels. GMs should give decent gear equivalent to level on top of random GM redeems. It is very hard to gear, especially for a newbie. Unless you have a veteran player hook you up.

- Allow players to use credits or exp to enable bonus for a limited time

// Officer Suggestions




// Rename Defender to Guardian, there is no such thing as a Jedi Defender. Guardian/Sentinel/Consular are the three recognized by the jedi temple.
// Rename Blademaster to Lightsaber Combat
    // Blademaster is a title given to the head lightsaber combat instructor at the sith academy, Battlemaster is the equivalent on the jedi side
    // Blademaster/Battlemaster would be really awesome to use for a secondary or tertiary class specializing in melee lightsaber combat, similar to Kaiburr Master, but doesnt make sense to have on a standard toon, especially a Jedi Sentinel because Blademaster is the sith variant
// Minor change to Jar'Kai, as it is slightly misrepresented in the MUD. In the actual lore, Jar'Kai refers to any more than one blade, which includes dual wielding and double-bladed sabers. Some Jedi/Sith throughout have even used three or four. Any more than one blade = Jar'Kai. It shouldn't be specific to Marauder.
// Lightsaber Combat
    // Lightsaber Combat would focus on the actual Lightsaber Forms
    // My initial idea is that once you learn Lightsaber Combat, each class will automatically assume one of two forms depending on which class you are. One while in offensive and one while in defensive. This will make both usable and things like Marauder being forced to always use offensive not happen.
    // I think this is a fun way to address the "identity" for each class Inchoa was talking about

// Form Breakdown
Form I : Shii-Cho , The Way of the Sarlacc
Shii-Cho Form, also known as Determination Form, uses wild, unpredictable attacks designed to distract and disarm their foes.

- Chance to Crit, but not as high as an offensive form


Form II : Makashi , The Way of the Ysalamiri
Makashi Form, also known as Contention Form, encourages precision and efficiency over power, using jabs, parries and light cuts over slashes, blocks and chops. Beings who focus on Makashi Form utilize calculated blade manipulation, intense focus, and expert timing to confuse and trap their opponents.

- Increased Deflect Chance
- Increased Crit Chance
- Extra Attack


Form III : Soresu , The Way of the Mynock

Juyo/Vaapad Form, also known as Ferocity Form, revels in the satisfaction of battle and victory. Those beings who focus on Juyo/Vaapad Form channel their emotions into their fighting, making heavy, sweeping strikes. Vaapad is a light side variation of Juyo created by Mace Windu and Sora Bulq.

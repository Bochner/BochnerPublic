* Rename Defender to Guardian, there is no such thing as a Jedi Defender. Guardian/Sentinel/Consular are the three recognized by the jedi temple.
* Rename Blademaster to Lightsaber Combat
    - Blademaster is a title given to the head lightsaber combat instructor at the sith academy, Battlemaster is the equivalent on the jedi side
    - Blademaster/Battlemaster would be really awesome to use for a secondary or tertiary class specializing in melee lightsaber combat, similar to Kaiburr Master, but doesnt make sense to have on a standard toon, especially a Jedi Sentinel because Blademaster is the sith variant
* Minor change to Jar'Kai, as it is slightly misrepresented in the MUD. In the actual lore, Jar'Kai refers to any more than one blade, which includes dual wielding and double-bladed sabers. Some Jedi/Sith throughout have even used three or four. Any more than one blade = Jar'Kai. It shouldn't be specific to Marauder.
* Lightsaber Combat
    - Lightsaber Combat would focus on the actual Lightsaber Forms
    - My initial idea is that once you learn Lightsaber Combat, each class will automatically assume one of two forms depending on which class you are. One while in offensive and one while in defensive. This will make both usable and things like Marauder being forced to always use offensive not happen.
    - I think this is a fun way to address the "identity" for each class Inchoa was talking about

```
-----------------------------=< Jar'kai >=-------------------------------

Usage: automatic
Usable by all lightsaber combatants except Consulars and Sith Lords who
specialize in force combat.

   Jar'kai is a fighting style that utilizes dual blades in combat, whether it 
be two one handed light sabers or a dual bladed saberstaff.  Many lightsaber wielders
employ this style, preferring to give themselves over to the traditionally offensive 
nature of the techniques employed.  

In game terms, the Jar'Kai skill demonstrates mastery by improving several other skills while wielding Dual Sabers:
- an additional throw with your offhand when using the Saber Throw skill
- increased critical chance while using Offensive Fighting
- user is granted the 'Offhand' skill
- Damage increased with using dual bladed sabers

improving several other skills:
- an advanced proficiency using Deflect
- an improved ability using the Defend skill

- All Jedi/Sith have Shii-Cho in normal mode
